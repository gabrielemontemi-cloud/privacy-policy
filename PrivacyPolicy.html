  <h1 style="color:#00ffff;">Privacy Policy – Beat The Tower</h1>

  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> October 23, 2025</p>

  <p><em>Beat The Tower</em> respects your privacy. This policy explains what information may be collected and how it is used when you play the game.</p>

  <h2 style="color:#00ffff;">1. What We Collect</h2>
  <p>The app itself does <strong>not</strong> directly collect, store, or transmit personal information to our own servers. Game data like best score, settings (e.g., audio volume, haptics), and preferences (e.g., leaderboard consent) are saved locally on your device via <em>UserDefaults</em>.</p>
  <p>However, the app integrates the following <strong>third-party services</strong>, which may process data to provide their features:</p>

  <h3 style="color:#00ffff;">1.1 Advertising (Google AdMob)</h3>
  <p>We use <strong>Google AdMob</strong> for banner, interstitial, and <strong>rewarded ads</strong> (e.g., to grant an in-game “Shield”). Depending on your choice in Apple’s App Tracking Transparency (ATT) prompt, AdMob may process:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Device identifiers (e.g., <strong>IDFA</strong>)</li>
    <li>Approximate location and device information (to improve ad relevance)</li>
    <li>Ad interaction data (views, clicks, impressions)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>If you <strong>deny tracking</strong>, ads are shown but are <strong>not personalized</strong>. Learn more: <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads" style="color:#00ffff;">Google AdMob Privacy &amp; Terms</a>.</p>

  <h3 style="color:#00ffff;">1.2 Game Center &amp; Leaderboards (Apple)</h3>
  <p>The game can show a <strong>global leaderboard</strong> using <strong>Apple Game Center</strong>. Before any score is shared, the app shows an in-app dialog to obtain your <strong>explicit consent</strong>. This preference can be changed later in the in-game <em>Settings</em>.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>If you agree:</strong> your score and a Game Center player identifier/alias (handled by Apple) may be submitted to Apple’s Game Center servers.</li>
    <li><strong>If you do not agree or turn it off later:</strong> your scores remain on the device and are <em>not</em> uploaded.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 style="color:#00ffff;">1.3 In-App Review Prompts (Apple)</h3>
  <p>The game may occasionally ask you to <strong>rate or review</strong> the app using Apple’s <em>SKStoreReviewController</em> (for example, after a small number of completed runs). Apple controls whether to show the prompt; no personal data is collected by us through this feature.</p>

  <h2 style="color:#00ffff;">2. Your Choices &amp; Controls</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Ads / Tracking (ATT):</strong> On first launch we ask permission to allow ad tracking. If denied, ads are not personalized. You can change this in <em>iOS Settings → Privacy &amp; Security → Tracking</em>.</li>
    <li><strong>Leaderboards Consent:</strong> The app shows an in-app consent dialog the first time. You can toggle this anytime in <em>Settings → “Global Leaderboard (share score)”</em>. If disabled, scores are not uploaded.</li>
    <li><strong>Game Center account:</strong> Manage via <em>iOS Settings → Game Center</em> (you can sign out or adjust preferences).</li>
    <li><strong>Audio &amp; Haptics:</strong> Manage inside the in-game <em>Settings</em>.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 style="color:#00ffff;">3. Rewarded Ads &amp; In-Game Items</h2>
  <p>Watching a rewarded ad (via AdMob) can grant a cosmetic or gameplay item (e.g., a “Shield” that auto-rescues once). Ad viewing information may be processed by AdMob to deliver and account for the reward. If an ad is unavailable, no reward is granted.</p>

  <h2 style="color:#00ffff;">4. Data Retention</h2>
  <p><em>Beat The Tower</em> does not operate its own servers for player accounts. Data processed by <strong>Google</strong> (AdMob) and <strong>Apple</strong> (Game Center, review prompts) follows their retention policies.</p>

  <h2 style="color:#00ffff;">5. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>The game is a casual title but not directed specifically to children. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided information to any third-party service through the app, please review those services’ settings and policies and contact us if you have questions.</p>

  <h2 style="color:#00ffff;">6. Security</h2>
  <p>Local data (scores, settings) is stored using iOS mechanisms like <em>UserDefaults</em>. Third-party services (Apple/Google) apply their own security measures to the data they handle.</p>

  <h2 style="color:#00ffff;">7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this policy from time to time. Material changes will be reflected by updating the “Last updated” date above.</p>
